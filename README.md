# MotiveDetection
Through social media induced tourism people are drawn to places that were previously not experiencing much touristic attentation. Drastic and rapid changes in a location's popularity can have serious effects on the local population, the infrastructure and, last but not least on the environment. Therefore, the monitoring and analysis of social media induced tourism is more important than ever before to ensure local agencies to act in time and occurding to the observed circumstances. Locations that experienced strong attention on social media such as Instagram where shown to be characterised by distinct, reoccuring motifs images. We regard motifs as a collection of images which depict the same landscape element(s) from a similar viewpoint. Therefore, the scenic focus, angle and position of the observer are important criteria to decide if two images belong to the same motif or not. This implies that images which show the same landscape element(s) are not automatically considered a motif. These motifs are used as proxy to indicate the locations of exsiting or upcoming social media induced tourism hot spots.

This pipeline uses spatial clustering (HDBSCAN) and computer vision image analysis (SIFT) to detect motifs in images.

The figure shows cultural and landscape motifs (orange dots) which were detected in the YFCC100M (Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million) dataset for the Natura2000 regions. For visualisation a sub sample of the total 92 motifs are displayed with an image.
