# MotiveDetection
Through social media induced tourism people are drawn to places that were previously not experiencing much touristic attentation. Drastic and rapid changes in a location's popularity can have serious effects on the local population, the infrastructure and, last but not least on the environment. Therefore, the monitoring and analysis of social media induced tourism is more important than ever before to ensure local agencies to act in time and occurding to the observed circumstances. Locations that experienced strong attention on social media such as Instagram where shown to be characterised by distinct, reoccuring Motive Images. These images are used as proxy to indicate the locations of exsiting or upcoming social media induced tourism hot spots.

This pipeline uses spatial clustering (HDBSCAN) and computer vision image analysis (SIFT) to detect motifs in images.
